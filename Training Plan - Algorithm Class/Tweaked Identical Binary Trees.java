/*
Determine whether two given binary trees are identical assuming any number of ‘tweak’s are allowed. A tweak is defined as a swap of the children of one node in the tree.

Examples

        5
      /    \
    3        8
  /   \
1      4

and

        5
      /    \
    8        3
           /   \
          1     4

the two binary trees are tweaked identical.

How is the binary tree represented?

We use the level order traversal sequence with a special symbol "#" denoting the null node.

For Example:

The sequence [1, 2, 3, #, #, 4] represents the following binary tree:

    1
  /   \
 2     3
      /
    4
